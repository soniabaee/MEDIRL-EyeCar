## Overview
Inspired by human visual attention, we introduce a Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MEDIRL) framework for modeling the visual attention allocation of drivers in imminent rear-end collisions. MEDIRL is composed of visual, driving, and attention modules. Given a front-view driving video and corresponding eye fixations from humans, the visual and driving modules extract generic and driving-specific visual features, respectively. Finally, the attention module learns the intrinsic task-sensitive reward functions induced by eye fixation policies recorded from attentive drivers. MEDIRL uses the learned policies to predict visual attention allocation of drivers. We also introduce EyeCar, a new driver visual attention dataset during accident-prone situations. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that MEDIRL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on driving task-related visual attention allocation on the following large-scale driving attention benchmark datasets: DR(eye)VE, BDD-A, and DADA-2000. The code and dataset are provided for reproducibility.

## Dataset - EyeCar 
We select 21 front-view videos that were captured in various traffic, weather, and day light conditions. Each video is 30sec in length and contains typical driving tasks (e.g., lane-keeping, merging-in, and braking) ending to rear-end collisions. Note that all the conditions were counterbalanced among all the participants. Moreover, EyeCar provides information about the speed and GPS of the ego-vehicle. In addition, each video frame comprises 4.6 vehicles on average, making EyeCar driving scenes more complex than other visual attention datasets. The [EyeCar dataset](https://github.com/soniabaee/eyeCar/tree/master/EyeCar) contains 3.5h of gaze behavior (aggregated and raw) from the 20 participants, as well as more than 315,000 rear-end collisions video frames. In EyeCar dataset, we account for the sequence of eye fixations, and thus we emphasize on attention shift to the salient regions in a complex driving scene. EyeCar also provides a rich set of annotations (e.g., scene tagging, object bounding, lane marking, etc.). You can accesss to the data in this [EyeCar](https://github.com/soniabaee/eyeCar/tree/master/EyeCar). Compared  to  prior  datasets,  EyeCar  is  the  only dataset  captured  from  a  point-of-view (POV)  perspective, involving collisions, and including metadata for both speedand  GPS.  EyeCar  also  has  the  largest  average  number  of vehicles per scene, and gaze data for 20 participants.

## Modules of MEDIRL
![medirl-visual-module](https://github.com/soniabaee/eyeCar/blob/master/figures/visual.png)
1. **The visual module**: The visual module extracts low and mid-level visual cues that are useful for a variety of visual attention tasks. We rely on pre-existing models for semantic and instance segmentation, as well as depth estimation. In addition, we propose an approach to detect brake lights and traffic lights.

2. **The driving module**: The driving module extracts driving-specific visual features for driving tasks.

3. **The attention module**: Drivers pay attention to the task-related regions of the scene to filter out irrelevant information and ultimately make optimal decisions. Drivers do this with a sequence of eye fixations. To learn this process in various driving tasks ending in rear-end collisions, we cast it as a maximum inverse reinforcement learning approach.


## Some Results:

## Requirements

The simplest way to clone the development environment is with the 
`anaconda-project` and `conda-env` systems; these can be installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) with the command

```bash
conda install anaconda anaconda-project
```

All necessary packages are found in `anaconda-project.yml`. To create an Anaconda virtual environment, run

```bash
rm environment.yml #if `environment.yml` already exists
anaconda-project export-env-spec -n medirl ./environment.yml
conda-env create -n medirl -f environment.yml
conda activate medirl
```

To deactivate the virtual environment, run

```bash
conda deactivate
```


To run a jupyter notebook inside this virtual environment, activate the
virtual env `medirl` and run

```bash
(medirl)$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=medirl
```

where the `(medirl)` prefix indicates that you are currently in the 
`medirl` virtual environment. Then, select the "medirl" kernel 
after creating or opening a jupyter notebook.


## Model
You can run the main script to get the result of each component:

```bash
python main.py
```
We saved the best/last of models of each module in [Models](https://github.com/soniabaee/eyeCar/tree/master/Models) folder.
